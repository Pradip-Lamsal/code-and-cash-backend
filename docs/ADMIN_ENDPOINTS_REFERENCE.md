# Admin API Endpoints Reference

This document provides a quick reference of all admin-specific endpoints available in the Code and Cash platform for frontend integration.

## Admin Credentials

A default admin account is created using the script in `scripts/create-admin.js`. The default credentials are:

```
Email: admin@codeandcash.com
Password: admin123456
```

To create a new admin account, run:

```
node scripts/create-admin.js
```

## Frontend Integration

A helper utility `adminAPI.js` has been created in the `frontend-integration` directory that you can copy to your frontend project. It provides methods for all admin operations.

### Using the Admin API

```javascript
// Import the Admin API
import adminAPI from "./path/to/adminAPI";

// Login and authenticate
const loginResponse = await fetch("http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: "admin@codeandcash.com",
    password: "admin123456",
  }),
});

const { token } = await loginResponse.json();

// Set token for all future requests
adminAPI.setToken(token);

// Check if user has admin access
const { isAdmin, user } = await adminAPI.checkAdminAccess();

if (isAdmin) {
  // User has admin access, load admin dashboard
  const stats = await adminAPI.getStats();
  console.log("Admin stats:", stats);

  // Load users
  const { users, pagination } = await adminAPI.getUsers();
  console.log("Users:", users);
} else {
  // Redirect to access denied page
  console.error("Access denied: User is not an admin");
}
```
