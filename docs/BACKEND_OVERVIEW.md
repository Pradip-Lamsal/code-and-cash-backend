# Code and Cash Backend - Complete System Overview

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Stack**: Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB + JWT Authentication  
**Purpose**: Freelance coding task platform where users apply for paid programming tasks

## 📊 Core Data Models

### User Model

- Authentication (JWT with session tracking)
- Profiles (name, email, skills, bio, profile image)
- Roles: `user` | `admin`
- Active sessions management

### Task Model

- Task details (title, description, company, category, difficulty)
- Financial (payout: $0-$10,000)
- Status workflow: `open` → `in_progress` → `completed` | `cancelled`
- Embedded applicants array and submissions array
- Requirements, skills, tags, deadline

### TaskApplication Model

- Links User ↔ Task with application workflow
- Status: `pending` → `accepted` → `completed` | `rejected` | `cancelled`
- File submissions, progress tracking, feedback
- Payment status tracking

### BlacklistedToken Model

- JWT token invalidation system

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. **Register/Login** → JWT token issued with user data
2. **Protected Routes** → Bearer token required in Authorization header
3. **Admin Routes** → Additional `role: "admin"` verification
4. **Session Management** → Active session tracking with device info
5. **Logout** → Token blacklisted, session terminated

### Security Features

- JWT with configurable expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session limit per user (prevents multiple logins)
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Input validation & sanitization
- CORS configuration
- File upload security

## 👤 User Journey & Workflow

### 1. Task Discovery

- **Browse Tasks**: `GET /api/tasks` - View all available tasks (public)
- **Filter/Search**: By category, difficulty, payout range
- **Task Details**: `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Full task information

### 2. Application Process

- **Apply**: `POST /api/applications/apply/:taskId`
  - Creates TaskApplication with status `pending`
  - Adds user to task's applicants array
- **Track Applications**: `GET /api/applications/my` - View all applied tasks
- **Application Status**: pending → accepted → completed

### 3. Work Submission

- **Submit Files**: `POST /api/applications/:applicationId/submit`
  - Upload PDF/DOCX work files
  - Files stored in `uploads/submissions/`
- **Track Progress**: Update completion percentage
- **Withdraw**: `DELETE /api/applications/:applicationId/withdraw`

### 4. Completion & Payment

- Admin reviews submission → approves/rejects
- Status updates: submitted → approved → payment processed

## 👑 Admin Management & Control

### 1. Platform Overview

### 4. Application Review System

- **View Applications**: `GET /api/admin/task-applications` - All user applications
- **Approve/Reject**: `PATCH /api/admin/applications/:applicationId/status`
  - Status: pending → accepted/rejected
  - When accepted: task assigned to user, status → in_progress
  - Optional feedback message

### 5. Submission Review & Grading

- **User Submissions**: `GET /api/admin/user-submissions/:userId` - All submissions by user
- **Download Files**: `GET /api/admin/submissions/:submissionId/download` - Secure file access
- **Grade Work**: `PATCH /api/admin/submissions/:submissionId/status`
  - Status: pending → approved/rejected
